# **Results**

This section presents the spatial distribution of flood susceptibility across the Upazilas of the Rangpur Division. Flood susceptibility was categorized into **Very Low**, **Low**, **Moderate**, **High**, and **Very High** based on the AHP-weighted Flood Susceptibility Index (FSI).

Upazila-wise areas were calculated using the **Tabulate Area** tool in ArcMap.
The proportion of susceptible land was derived using:

[
\text{% Susceptible} = \frac{\text{High} + \text{Very High}}{\text{Total Area}} \times 100
]

## **2. Heatmap — Relative Flood Susceptibility**

A heatmap was generated to visually compare susceptibility levels between Upazilas.
Darker shades represent areas with higher flood vulnerability.

# **Interpretation of Results**

### **Highly Susceptible Upazilas ( > 50% )**

* **Kurigram (79.30%)**
* **Lalmonirhat (65.29%)**
* **Nilphamari (65.06%)**

These Upazilas fall within the **Teesta–Brahmaputra floodplain**, where braided rivers, low-lying topography, and intense monsoon discharge consistently trigger severe riverine flooding.

---

### **Moderately Susceptible Upazilas (20–50%)**

* **Gaibandha (44.04%)**
* **Rangpur (39.42%)**
* **Dinajpur (22.66%)**

Moderate susceptibility in these areas is linked to **flat terrain, seasonal rainfall, and drainage congestion**.

---

### **Low Susceptibility Upazilas ( < 10% )**

* **Panchagarh (1.80%)**
* **Thakurgaon (4.56%)**

These northern Upazilas lie on **higher alluvial terraces** with better natural drainage, resulting in minimal flood exposure.

---

# **Key Findings**

* Flood susceptibility is **highly concentrated along major floodplains** in the eastern and central districts.
* Over **65% of land** in multiple Upazilas is prone to recurrent seasonal flooding.
* Upland areas with elevated terrain exhibit **very low susceptibility**, functioning as hydrological buffers.
* The spatial pattern closely matches historical flood records and hydrological behavior of northern Bangladesh.
